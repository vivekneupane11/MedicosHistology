Its functions are both exocrine and endocrine. Exocrine functionis concerned with production of the three digestive enzymes trypsin,amylase,   and   lipase.   Trypsin   assists   in   the   digestion   of   proteins.Amylase helps to break down large molecules of starch into smallermolecules of maltose, which eventually are broken down into glucoseand stored in the liver. Lipase assists in breaking down lipids into fattyacids and glycerol. These are discharged through the pancreatic ductinto the duodenum. The endocrine portion of the pancreas consists ofmultiple clusters of specialized cells, which are termed theislets ofLangerhans. The specialized cells are classified as α-cells and β-cells.The   function   of   β-cells   is   to   produce   insulin,   and   α-cells   produceglucagon, both of which are discharged directly into the blood from thepancreas.  Insulin   and   glucagon  regulate  carbohydrate   metabolism.Insulin’s role in this function includes making and storing glucose in theliver and in muscle tissue throughout the body and enabling the bodyto burn the stored glucose. When the blood flowing from the pancreasto the liver through the portal vein is hyperglycemic, insulin is releasedinto the bloodstream via the portal vein. Glucagon acts in a similarmanner, but it functions to increase the glucose level in blood. If the blood   released   into   the   portal   vein   is   hypoglycemic,   glucagonstimulates   the   liver   to   break   down   glycogen   into   glucose,   thusincreasing the glucose level in the bloodstream."
